        <h2>What is Word Counter?</h2>
        <p>
            Apart from counting words and characters, our online editor can help you to improve word choice and writing style,
            and, optionally, help you to detect grammar mistakes and plagiarism. To check word count, simply place your cursor
            into the text box above and start typing.
        </p>

        <p>
            You'll see the number of characters and words increase or decrease as you type, delete, and edit them. You can also
            copy and paste text from another program over into the online editor above. The Auto-Save feature will make sure you
            won't lose any changes while editing, even if you leave the site and come back later.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Word Counter?</h2>
        <p>
            Knowing the word count of a text can be important. For example, if an author has to write a minimum or maximum
            amount of words for an article, essay, report, story, book, paper, you name it. WordCounter will help to make sure its
            word count reaches a specific requirement or stays within a certain limit.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, WordCounter shows you the top 10 keywords and keyword density of the article you're writing. This allows
            you to know which keywords you use how often and at what percentages. This can prevent you from over-using certain
            words or word combinations and check for the best distribution of keywords in your writing.
        </p>

        <h2>Details Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In the Details overview, you can see the average speaking and reading time for your text, while Reading Level is an
            indicator of the education level a person would need to understand the words you’re using.
